So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).

This is fine for small networks with a few tensors, but it would be extremely inconvenient and error-prone to track tens or hundreds of tensors in larger networks.\n","\n","PyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n","\n","To use the Module API, follow the steps below:\n","\n","1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`. \n","\n","2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n","\n","3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`!

It is not as flexible as `nn.Module`, because you cannot specify more complex topology than a feed-forward stack, but it's good enough for many use cases.\n","\n","### Sequential API: Two-Layer Network\n","Let's see how to rewrite our two-layer fully connected network example with `nn.Sequential`, and train it using the training loop defined above.\n","\n","Again, you don't need to tune any hyperparameters here, but you shoud achieve above 40% accuracy after one epoch of training."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YM48fyBGQnWC","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":561},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1599775689922,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":77195,"user":{"displayName":"Konstantin Kanchev","photoUrl":"","userId":"06593590885973292683"}},"outputId":"d37b874a-3b64-41af-a43e-3e75b97dcdf3"},"source":["# We need to wrap `flatten` function in a module in order to stack it\n","# in nn.Sequential\n","class Flatten(nn.Module):\n","    def forward(self, x):\n","        return flatten(x)\n","\n","hidden_layer_size = 4000\n","learning_rate = 1e-2\n","\n","model = nn.Sequential(\n","    Flatten(),\n","    nn.Linear(3 * 32 * 32, hidden_layer_size),\n","    nn.ReLU(),\n","    nn.Linear(hidden_layer_size, 10),\n",")\n","\n","# you can use Nesterov momentum in optim.SGD\n","optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate,\n","                     momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)\n","\n","train_part34(model, optimizer)"],"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Iteration 0, loss = 2.2946\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 142 / 1000 correct (14.20)\n","\n","Iteration 100, loss = 1.6872\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 405 / 1000 correct (40.50)\n","\n","Iteration 200, loss = 1.6261\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 404 / 1000 correct (40.40)\n","\n","Iteration 300, loss = 1.9208\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 415 / 1000 correct (41.50)\n","\n","Iteration 400, loss = 1.8035\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 399 / 1000 correct (39.90)\n","\n","Iteration 500, loss = 1.8125\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 436 / 1000 correct (43.60)\n","\n","Iteration 600, loss = 1.5759\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 421 / 1000 correct (42.10)\n","\n","Iteration 700, loss = 1.5912\n","Checking accuracy on validation set\n","Got 460 / 1000 correct (46.00)\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qjPqa5BxQnWF","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Sequential API: Three-Layer ConvNet\n","Here you should use `nn.Sequential` to define and train a three-layer ConvNet with the same architecture we used in Part III:\n","\n","1.

Do your networks train faster?\n","- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n","    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n","    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n","    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n","- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n","- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.\n","\n","### Tips for training\n","For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n","- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n","- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n","  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n","  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n","\n","### Have fun and happy training!
