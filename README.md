# CS231n-Assignment-Solution
Solutions for the first assignment of Standford's free CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.

## Assignment 1

1. Implementations of linear classifiers for image classification
    * k-Nearest Neighbor
    * Support Vector Machine
    * Softmax

2. A two layer preceptron for image classification which utilises PCA and numerous optimisation functions (Momentum, AdaGrad, RMSprop and Adam)

3. An introduction to feature extraction

## Assignment 2

1. A fully connected neural network model with dropout, batchnorm/layernorm and further optimisation algorythms.

2. A convolutional neural network model with implementations for convolutional layers and maxPool layers.

3. An intoduction to two of the most widely used machine learning frameworks and the numerous levels at which they can be utilised. (For this assignment I completed the notebooks on PyTorch as I had prevously worked with TensorFlow)

## Assignment 3

1. Implementations of a vanilla Recurrent Neural Network and a Long Short-Term Memory Network for image captioning

2. A couple of network visualisation techniques
    * Saliency maps 
    * Class Visualization
    * Fooling Images

3. An imletionmentation of a style transfer algorythm in Pytorch with a pretrained SqueezeNet

4. An implementation of a generative adverserial network (GAN) in PyTorch on the MNIST dataset
